Middleware
----------

Middleware is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality.

Use Middleware for logging, crash reporting, async tasks.



Async Actions
--------------
Example with fetching a list of users from an endpoint.

state =  {
	loading: true,
	data: [],
	error: "",
};

ACTIONS = [
   FETCH_USERS_REQUEST: 'FETCH_USERS_REQUEST',
   FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS: 'FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS',
   FETCH_USERS_FAILURE: 'FETCH_USERS_FAILURE'
]


Async Action Creators.
----------------------

'redux-thunk' is the standard way to define the async action Creators.
It's a Middleware we apply to our reduxStore.

thunk-middleware returns a function instead of an action object.
